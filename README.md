# Better tridents
Better tridents is a datapack for minecraft java edition that creates a crafting recipe for the trident item and gives the user status effects when they hold tridents that have certain enchantments. I plan to accompany this in the future with a mod that add some more sea based items and possibly different varieties of tridents.

## For creators
If you are a content creator and you would like to use this pack in a video then all you have to do is credit me in the description and link the repository. I'd love to see what you have made and what you think about the pack.

## Installation instructions
The easiest way to install datapacks on github is using the git command line tool. Simply move into the directory of the world and then in the datapacks folder run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/EmeraldThunder1/better-tridents/
```

Alternatively you can use the gh tool to install the datapack:

```
gh repo clone EmeraldThunder1/better-tridents
```

If you don't have git installed you can just download the source code from the website and drop the folder in your datapacks folder.

## Usage
The crafting recipe for tridents is as follows:

The effects that are applied when you hold a trident are as follows:

If you would like to suggest any to be added just create an issue on the repo, I'm currently implementing different effect levels for different enchantment levels.
